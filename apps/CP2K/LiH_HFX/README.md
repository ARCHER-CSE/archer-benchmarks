# CP2K LiH-HFX Benchmark

## Introduction

We use the LiH-HFX benchmark. According to the [CP2K benchmarks](https://www.cp2k.org/performance) page:

"This is a single-point energy calculation using Quickstep GAPW (Gaussian and Augmented Plane-Waves) with hybrid Hartree-Fock exchange. It consists of a 216 atom Lithium Hydride crystal with 432 electrons in a 12.3 Ã…3 cell. These types of calculations are generally around one hundred times the computational cost of a standard local DFT calculation, although this can be reduced using the Auxiliary Density Matrix Method (ADMM). Using OpenMP is of particular benefit here as the HFX implementation requires a large amount of memory to store partial integrals. By using several threads, fewer MPI processes share the available memory on the node and thus enough memory is available to avoid recomputing any integrals on-the-fly, improving performance. "

_This benchmark is best for large core/node counts (>24 nodes) as it requires a lot of memory. Using fewer than this number of nodes results in an out of memory error._

## Running the benchmark

### ARCHER2

#### Setup Calculation

In order to run the benchmark, first a setup calculation must be performed to produce an input wave function file. This setup calculation can be carried out on 2 nodes, taking under a minute.

To run this setup calculation, copy `input_bulk_B88_3.inp` and `BASIS_OPT` into a working directory. Also copy the batch script `setup_ARCHER.pbs` into this working directory, remembering to change the budget code, and path to the `CP2K.psmp` executable. Now submit this job.

Once the job has completed, rename `LiH_bulk_3-RESTART.wfn` to `B88.wfn`. This is the input file required by the benchmark.

#### Benchmark Calculation

Once the input file `B88.wfn` has been created (see above), the main benchmark calculation can be run. Copy `input_bulk_HFX_3.inp`, `BASIS_OPT` and `B88.wfn` into a working directory.

Also copy the `LiH_HFX_ARCHER2.pbs` batch script into your work directory, remembering to change the budget code, path to the `CP2K.psmp` executable, as well as the node/core/thread counts to the appropriate values. __Please note:__ the benchmark requires a lot of memory, so must be run on 128 or more nodes. Also, using several OpenMP threads per MPI process is beneficial for saving memory.

Once the benchmark has completed (typically takes <10 minutes) the time taken can be determined from the job's output by looking for `CP2K` in the timing information:
